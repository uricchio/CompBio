FAQ:
  - question: Are there any prerequisites for the course?
    answer: Yes, students need BIO 13 and BIO 14 or consent of the instructor. No previous programming, bioinformatics, or computer science 
             experience is required.
  - question: Is the course open to graduate students?
    answer: Yes, graduate students are encouraged to enroll, especially if they lack prior programming experience.
  
  - question: What is computational biology?
    answer: Computational biology applies methods and technoliges to questions that arise from biology. These may include evolutionary questions (what can we learn about species'
            past from genetic variation?) and biomedical questions (how can we design targeted therapeutics for diseases?). As biological data has increased in scale in recent years,
            automated summarization and interpretation of this data has become essential for unraveling biological mysteries.
