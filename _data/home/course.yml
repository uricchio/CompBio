- p: <p>Biological questions have fascinated and preoccupied humankind throughout our history. We have pondered the roles of “nature” and “nurture” in determining individual traits and the origins of species to the development of technologies that can treat diseases or control our environment. Until quite recently, we had relatively little data to answer most of these questions, but many competing theories and models to explain biological observations. A revolution in biological data generation is underway, with genomes and transcriptomes being sequenced at astonishing rates. Other types of data, such as digital images, biological annotations, and molecular profiles, are also expanding rapidly. </p> 

- p: <p>This increased scale of biological data requires automated summarization and interpretation of biological data.  In this course, we will ask “how can biological questions be posed and answered using computational approaches”? We will approach this question through the lens of current open questions in evolutionary biology and molecular medicine.  We will develop basic programming skills and learn about a range of widely used computational methods. More importantly, we will develop a conceptual basis for asking and answering biological questions using computational tools. </p>
