syllabus:
  
  - heading: Learning Objectives
    content: "The course will wind through a number of topics in contemporary biology, with approximately one topic every two weeks.  Each module will follow a general outline of asking a 
              biological question, recasting it as a computational problem, proposing a solution to the computational problem, and finally implementing the solution in computer code.  
              We will introduce real or simulated datasets for each of these problems. <br><br>

              <ul>
              <li><i>Ask a biological question</i>: We will focus a substantial portion of the course around ongoing discussions in both popular science journalism and the 
              scientific literature. By the end of the course, students should be able to read a journalistic article about a problem in computational biology, identify the 
              research question being posed, and describe why a computational approach may be needed for this problem. They should be able to broadly describe several open 
              biological/evolutionary questions that researchers are currently investigating using computational approaches. </li><br>

              <li><i>Reduce a biological problem to a computational problem</i>: Many biological questions can be restated as computational problems once the appropriate data have 
              been collected. Students should be able to take a biological question and reduce it to a computational problem within the realm of a range of topics discussed in the 
              course. </li><br>

              <li><i>Propose a computational solution</i>: Having identified the biological problem as a computational problem, students should be able propose a computational 
              solution (i.e., an algorithm). This is not a computer science course! We will not focus on correctness proofs or computational complexity. Rather we will attempt to 
              provide intuitive explanations for the operation of algorithms, and we will expect that students should be able to explain how/why the algorithm works. </li><br>

              <li><i>Implement a solution</i>: We will use Python to implement solutions to the computational problems introduced in the course. Students will use real or 
              simulated datasets to answer the questions posed. While we will emphasize basic coding principles, writing beautiful code will not be a main focus of the course. </li> </ul>"

  - heading: Software
    content: "We will use a wide range of software tools in this class, but most importantly we will be writing our software in Python3. You will need access to a computer on which
              you can code Python3, or alternatively you will need to login remotely to another machine that has Python3. <br><br>

              Below please find a list of software tools that we will use throughout the course. While it would be helpful to download and install each of these tools before
              the beginning of the course, please note that only Python3 absolutely needs to be installed! If you have any difficulty installing Python before day 1 please email
              the instructors. Please note that Python may already be installed on your machine. <br><br>

              </ul>" 

  - heading: Materials  
    content: "We will use the textbook <i>Computing for Biologists</i> for most of sections in this course. Occassional additional readings will be assigned and distrubuted as PDFs to the
              class. <br><br>
              <ul>
              <li> <i>Computing for Biologists: Python Programming and Principles</i>,

  - heading: Additional resources
    content: "A few optional resources that may provide insights not available from your textbook. We will update this list throughout the term. 
              If you find a helpful resource please feel free to message your TA or instructor so we can share it with the class. Only free 
              resources will be posted to this list.

              "

  - heading: Assignments
    content: "There will be four types of assignments in this course: <br> <br>
               <ul>
               <li> <i>Coding assignments</i>: There will be 6 coding assignments throughout the semester, approximately one every two weeks for the first 12 weeks of the course (we may push back a week during midterms, since we do not have a midterm).  Students will have the opportunity to receive ungraded feedback from the course TA about a week before the final assignment is due.</li> <br> 
               <li> <i>Scientist spotlights</i>: Asking biological questions is a central component of this course. Each week we will cover the work and life of a contemporary scientist working in computational biology.  We will read one of their academic papers, discuss how their work relates to the broader computational/biological topics that we are discussing, and learn about their career trajectory and life. Students will be responsible for answering a series of short answer questions about each scientist and their work. </li> <br>
               <li> <i>Final project</i>:  The final project will be similar to the coding assignments, but each student will pick a topic of their own. They can submit an implementation of an analysis that is similar to one in a published paper or preprint using public data and their own implementation of an algorithm along with a short “technical report” on their work, or they can write a short literature review on a specific area of computational biology in which they are interested.       </li> <br>
               <li> <i>Meeting with instructor</i>: We will have two required one-on-one meetings with the instructor. These are pass-fail, and all you have to do to get credit is show up. Their purpose is to help us assess how we (i.e., the instructional team) are doing, and what we can do to support you in the classroom and beyone. </li> <br>
               </ul>"

  - heading: Late policy  
    content: "There is a lot going on in the world right now, and it is the firm belief of the instructional team for this course 
              that student's mental health and well being comes first. If there is something happening in your life that will make
              it challenging for you to complete assignments within the allotted window, please come talk to us or a trusted academic advisor.
              It is highly likely that we will be able to work something out. If you are uncomforable speaking directly to the Instructor, please
              feel free to speak to the TA and have them refer your concern.<br><br>
              
              In general, we will allow a grace period of three business days for the first two late assignments (including the final project), 
              no questions asked. In other words, if an assignment is due on Friday and you don't turn it in until Wednesday, that's OK in the first two instances.
              Subsequent late assignments will be subject to a 20 percent penalty per day late.<br><br>
     
              In addition to personal challenges, there may be events that make it challenging for all
              of us to work. We will try to be sensitive to these types of events and provide leniency for the whole class under such circumstances. We encourage the 
              students to make us aware of any such events."
