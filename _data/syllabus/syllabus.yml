  - heading: Learning Objectives
    content: "The course will wind through a number of topics in contemporary biology, with approximately one topic every two weeks.  Each module will follow a general outline of asking a biological question, recasting it as a computational problem, proposing a solution to the computational problem, and finally implementing the solution in computer code.  We will introduce real or simulated datasets for each of these problems. <br><br>

<ul>
<li><em>Ask a biological question</em>: We will focus a substantial portion of the course around ongoing discussions in both popular science journalism and the scientific literature. By the end of the course, students should be able to read a journalistic article about a problem in computational biology, identify the research question being posed, and describe why a computational approach may be needed for this problem. They should be able to broadly describe several open biological/evolutionary questions that researchers are currently investigating using computational approaches. </li><br>

<li><em>Reduce a biological problem to a computational problem</em>: Many biological questions can be restated as computational problems once the appropriate data have been collected. Students should be able to take a biological question and reduce it to a computational problem within the realm of a range of topics discussed in the course. </li><br>

<li><em>Propose a computational solution</em>: Having identified the biological problem as a computational problem, students should be able propose a computational solution (i.e., an algorithm). This is not a computer science course! We will not focus on correctness proofs or computational complexity. Rather we will attempt to provide intuitive explanations for the operation of algorithms, and we will expect that students should be able to explain how/why the algorithm works. </li><br>

<li><em>Implement a solution</em>: We will use Python to implement solutions to the computational problems introduced in the course. Students will use real or simulated datasets to answer the questions posed. While we will emphasize basic coding principles, writing beautiful code will not be a main focus of the course. </li> </ul>"

  - heading: Software
    content: "We will use a wide range of software tools in this class, but most importantly we will be writing our software in Python3. You will need access to a computer on which
              you can code Python3, or alternatively you will need to login remotely to another machine that has Python3. <br><br>

              Below please find a list of software tools that we will use throughout the course. While it would be helpful to download and install each of these tools before
              the beginning of the course, please note that only Python3 absolutely needs to be installed! If you have any difficulty installing Python before day 1 please email
              the instructors. Please note that Python may already be installed on your machine. <br><br>

              <ul>

              <li> Python3: </li>
              <li> numpy: </li>
              <li> SLiM: </li>
              <li> stdpopsim: </li>
              </ul> " 

  - heading: Materials  
    content: "We will use the textbook <i>Computing for Biologists</i> for most of sections in this course. Occassional additional readings will be assigned and distrubuted as PDFs to the
              class. <br><br>
              <ul>
              <li> <i>Computing for Biologists: Python Programming and Principles</i>, Ran Liebskind-Hadas and Eliot Bush. <a href=https://books.google.com/books/about/Computing_for_Biologists.html?id=E8HOBAAAQBAJ>link here</a>"
  
   - heading: Assignments
     content: "There will be four types of assignments in this course:
               <ul>
               <li> <i>Coding assignments</i>: 
               <li> <i>Scientist spotlights</i>:
               <li> <i>Final project</i>:
               <li> <i>Meeting with instructor</i>:
               </ul> "

    content: "Porttitor leo a diam sollicitudin. Interdum varius sit amet mattis vulputate enim nulla.
      Mattis vulputate enim nulla aliquet. Odio ut sem nulla pharetra diam sit amet. 
      Suspendisse interdum consectetur libero id faucibus nisl."
